# Installation on RHEL9 and Ubuntu 22.04


## Installation on Ubuntu 22.04
BridgeCTL should technically work on any Linux distro with Python3.10 or newer and Docker or Podman installed. However, we only test on [RHEL9](./Installation_RHEL.md), [AmazonLinux2023](./Installation_AmazonLinux.md) and latest [Ubuntu LTS](./Installation_Ubuntu.md)


## Prerequisites 
- Python >= 3.10
- Python3-venv
- Docker

## Install Docker
Follow official Docker documentation for installation on [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu).

> Running BridgeCTL as root is not the best idea. We need to allow current user to run Docker containers without root privileges, by adding user to the docker group

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

## Install Python3.10 ond venv

Ubuntu 22.04 comes with Python 3.10 pre-installed. However, Ubuntu does not bundle venv with Python3.10 anymore. You need to install it:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install python3-venv
```


## Install BridgeCTL
BridgeCTL is easy to install. Just download and run the bridgectl_setup.py script using the following two commands:

```bash
python3 bridgectl_setup.py
```

If installation is successful you should see menu bellow, you can head to the [Usage](./Usage.md) section for more detail:
