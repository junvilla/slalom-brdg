# Building Bridge Images with BridgeCTL

BridgeCTL simplifies the process of building Tableau Bridge container images by automating several key steps, including driver installation, security configuration, and Bridge software installation.

## Overview

BridgeCTL automates the following aspects of the image building process:
- Downloads and installs the latest Tableau Bridge RPM
- Configures container security and user permissions
- Manages UNC path mappings
- Integrates database drivers through the Driver Caddy framework

## Prerequisites

Before building a Bridge image, ensure you have:
- BridgeCTL installed on your system
- Docker installed and running
- Internet access to download Bridge software and drivers
- Sufficient permissions to build Docker images
