# Installation on Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023)


## Installation on AL2023
BridgeCTL should technically work on any Linux distro with Python3.10 or newer and Docker or Podman installed. However, we only test on [RHEL9](Installation_RHEL), [AmazonLinux2023](Installation_AmazonLinux) and latest [Ubuntu LTS](Installation_Ubuntu)


## Prerequisites 
- Python >= 3.10
- Docker


## Install Docker
AL2023 provides Docker from their own repository. If instructions bellow doesn't works, check the official [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-docker.html#install-docker-instructions)

```bash
sudo yum -y install docker
sudo service docker enable
sudo service docker start
```

> Running BridgeCTL as root is not the best idea. We need to allow current user to run Docker containers without root privileges, by adding user to the docker group

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

## Install Python3.10 or newer
AL2023 comes with Python 3.9.x preinstalled, but Python 3.11.x is available to be installed from the repository.
```bash
sudo yum -y install python3.11
```

> **Note:** Keep in mind that Python 3.9.x is still installed and will be used as alias for python3 command. We need to execute python3.11 explicitly (or change the alias).


## Install BridgeCTL
BridgeCTL is easy to install. Just download and run the bridgectl_setup.py script using the following two commands:

```bash
curl -OL https://github.com/tab-se/bridgectl/releases/download/setup/bridgectl_setup.py
python3.11 bridgectl_setup.py
```

If installation is successful you should see menu bellow, you can head to the [Usage](./Usage.md) section for more detail:
