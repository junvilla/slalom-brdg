# Welcome to the Tableau BridgeCTL Wiki

BridgeCTL is a local command-line utility for Tableau Bridge that addresses many of the pain points faced by Bridge administrators.

### Introduction
BridgeCTL will help you build your Tableau Bridge Linux container images including downloading and
installing the right database drivers and bridge rpm installer. Then it will help you easily configure and
run your bridge containers in Docker or Kubernetes with the correct connection settings. It has a convenient
log viewer for bridge container logs in docker, Kubernetes. It will also monitor the status and configuration of your
running bridge agents and can send you an alert if one of your agents becomes disconnected.
BridgeCTL can be installed on Linux, Windows or Mac.
