BridgeCTL provides a monitoring feature to send a Slack or Pager Duty notifications when any bridge agent becomes disconnected. It runs a background process at regular intervals which calls the Tableau Cloud API and checks agent connectivity status. If any of the agents is disconnected, a notification is sent.
