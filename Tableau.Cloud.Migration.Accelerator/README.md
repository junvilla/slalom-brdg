# Welcome to the Tableau Cloud Migration Accelerator by Slalom - Global Salesforce - Tableau

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Tableau Cloud Migration Accelerator Showcase**! This README.md file serves as an introductory document to guide you through the usage of the files included in this repository. The project consists of two main folders:

1. Tableau.Cloud.Migration.Accelerator
2. Wiiisdom Automation *(in development)*

### Tableau.Cloud.Migration.Accelerator

The first folder contains a set of Python scripts utilizing the Tableau Server Client and Tableau Migration libraries to accelerate a client's migration between Tableau Server to Tableau Cloud environments. These Python libraries, developed and maintained by Tableau, use REST API calls to get, download, create, and publish contents to and from Tableau sites.

To utilize the accelerator, please navigate to the ***Tableau.Cloud.Migration.Accelerator*** folder and refer to the README.md file provided within. The instructions detailed there will guide you on how to set up the required dependencies, execute the Python scripts, and leverage their functionalities effectively.
